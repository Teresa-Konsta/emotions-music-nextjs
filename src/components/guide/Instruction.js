                Three music notes are generated based on your current pulse rate.
                To improve your mood it is recommended to listen to some music not in the same vibe as these notes,
                and not in the opposite, but &ldquo;in the middle&rdquo;.&nbsp;
                For example, if a prototype generate you &ldquo;sad&rdquo; notes,
                minimalistic, jazz, soul or calm music should improve your mood.
