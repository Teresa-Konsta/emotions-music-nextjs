# Emotions to Music

This project aims to generate music notes based on your current mental state.
I put a complex psychoanalytical concept behind it.
Ideally, there should be a  polygraph for getting inputs from the user, I replaced it here with a manual input.
Thus, it is a software prototype to show how music based on emotional state can be generated.
The project can potentially be used as a part of mental therapy.
